Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in Python

## Description
A simple interactive **Rock-Paper-Scissors game** implemented in Python.  
The game lets the user play against the computer in the terminal, with **ASCII art** representing each choice for a fun visual experience.  

This project demonstrates the use of **conditional logic, random number generation, and user input handling** in Python.

## Features
- Interactive gameplay in the terminal.
- ASCII art for **Rock, Paper, and Scissors**.
- Validates user input and handles invalid entries.
- Computer randomly chooses its move.
- Determines winner and displays result with a friendly message.

## Concepts Used
- Python **`if-elif-else` statements** for game logic.  
- **Lists** to store choices and corresponding ASCII art.  
- **Random module** to simulate computer choice.  
- **User input** using `input()` and type conversion.  
- **Basic error handling** for invalid inputs.
